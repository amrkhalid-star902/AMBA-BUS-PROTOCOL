# AMBA-BUS-PROTOCOL
The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is a standardized framework that provides guidelines for connecting and coordinating various components or blocks within a System-on-Chip (SoC). Its purpose is to address important challenges encountered in SoC design. AMBA plays a crucial role in reducing the amount of silicon required for both on-chip and off-chip communications.

In this project different bus architectures : APB , AHP , AXI that are part of AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) are implemented.
